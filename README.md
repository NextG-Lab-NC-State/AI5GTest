# NextG Lab AI5GTest Codebase

This tool enables automated packet capture and processing of 5G O-RAN protocol traffic.  
It supports both live capture (via `tcpdump`) and offline `.pcap` file processing, decoding essential protocol layers like F1AP, NGAP, NAS-5GS, and MAC-NR, and exporting results in structured JSON format.
